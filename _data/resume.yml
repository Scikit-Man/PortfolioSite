      title: Winner of CS Dhruva Tech fest 
      desc: A decider in the end and a nail biting finish. The score was tied up 14-14 and race to 15 was the target. A silly mistake by opponent which resulted in a great victory for the Direwolves team. The player rushed in all alone!!! Not a good choice.
